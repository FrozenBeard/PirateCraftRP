# How to create the pack
Clone this repo into:
 ```%appdata%/.minecraft/resourcepacks``` on windows.
 ```~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/resourcepacks`` on MacOS
 ```~/.minecraft/resourcepacks`` on Linux

 No need to zip it up, it'll work fine as a folder, then you go in-game and select it from ```Options > Resource Packs...``` and make sure its above any other resource pack you are using.

# Download ZIP 
Go to the releases section and download latest version
https://github.com/PirateCraft/ResourcePack/releases

# Recommendation 
It is recommended to use the latest [OptiFine 1.12.2 HD U F5](https://optifine.net/downloadx?f=OptiFine_1.12.2_HD_U_F5.jar&x=8ba5193007a58520168e7f78ef7aff2f) (direct download link) in order for the custom textures like grapplinghook and event weapons to work. The gun textures will even work without Optifine.

# Todo
- Add in a few custom items for Custom named event weapons https://dokucraft.co.uk/stash/
- Figure out mod to replace "Realms" in the main menu with PirateCraft (mod) with online players/ two buttons, click to play and more information.
- Create logo like this for pack https://i.redd.it/kjhhzy3u42o41.png / https://external-preview.redd.it/MwOT7ERLKDT6Wws4NvRUm6rX-CTXmr1sChHOkYhFrnY.png?width=960&crop=smart&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1ebf7e0d0b29140e394f781dddd5232f7ec1575b maybe via https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0wGWKzQndQ for main menu
